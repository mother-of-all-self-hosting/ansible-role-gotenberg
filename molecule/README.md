# Molecule Testing

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

## Prerequisites

To utilize Molecule you need to prepare several requirements:

- **x86** computer running one of these operating systems that make use of [systemd](https://systemd.io/):
  - **Archlinux**
  - **CentOS**, **Rocky Linux**, **AlmaLinux**, or possibly other RHEL alternatives (although your mileage may vary)
  - **Debian** (10/Buster or newer)
  - **Ubuntu** (18.04 or newer, although [20.04 may be problematic](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/ansible.md#supported-ansible-versions) if you run the Ansible playbook on it)
- `root` access on the computer which Molecule runs against
- [Ansible](http://ansible.com/) program
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - Most distributions install Python by default, but some don't (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04) and require manual installation (something like `apt-get install python3`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  - Access to Docker UNIX socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is required by default

## Installation

To set up the environment for using Molecule, run the command below on the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv ./molecule/venv
source ./molecule/venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r ./molecule/requirements.txt
```

## Scenarios

Currently there is one testing scenario available.

### `default`

Tests a standard Gotenberg installation, and in particular that it actually converts documents.

Gotenberg's `/health` route reports both of its conversion engines as `up` without ever running a conversion, so this scenario does not stop at a reachable endpoint. It installs the service under a uid override and a read-only container root — the shape that every mash-playbook deployment has — and then asserts that:

- both conversion engines produce real PDF documents: `/forms/chromium/convert/html` and `/forms/libreoffice/convert` are each handed an input file, and their responses are checked for PDF magic bytes and a plausible size
- the running Gotenberg reports the version that `defaults/main.yml` pins
- the arguments that the role renders reach the process — the API is served only below the configured root path, and the unprefixed routes answer `404`
- the role's environment file reaches the process, including the `HOME` that keeps Chromium working on a read-only container root
- the container really does run under the overridden uid with a read-only root filesystem, so that the Chromium check above cannot quietly stop being a regression test

## Running

By default it is configured to run the scenarios on Ubuntu 26.04.

```bash
molecule test --scenario-name default
```

You can utilize other distributions by setting one to the `MOLECULE_DISTRO` environment variable:

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04
MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu2404 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 13
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian13 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 12
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian12 molecule test --scenario-name default
```
